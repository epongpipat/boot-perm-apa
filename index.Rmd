# Introduction

Currently, the APA statement includes: 

- Estimate
- Name of Statistic
- Degrees of Freedom (df)
- Statistical Value
- *p*-value

However, this is not always informative. The APA statement should include:

- Estimate and its Confidence Interval (CI)
- Name of Statistic
- Degrees of Freedom (df)
- Statistical Value
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Adjusted R^2 and its CI
- Permutated P-Value
